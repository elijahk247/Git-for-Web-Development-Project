    1. What is Semantic HTML? 

        We use the word semantic to describe tags with meaning. When we say semantic HTML,
        it means the tags that we are using have inherent descriptions as to what we are doing 

    2. What is HTML used for? 

        HTML is one of the languages that are used for web development.
        As described in the modules, we utilize HTML to create the foundation of a webpage.
        We use it to display data in a graphical form that can then be layered with CSS and JavaScript.

    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 

        Attributes are another way we can supply data to an element, which is used when we 
        need to include information that we don't want to render on the page

        The attribute goes in the opening tag of the element.
            ex. <a href="about">hello</a>
                -href is the attribute

    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?

        The h1 tag is one of six heading tags that are used to present the subject matter of the page.
        While it is possible to use the h1 tag multiple times, the best practice is to limit it to the
        most important heading for the webpage. 

    5. Name two tags that have required attributes

        Two tags that require attributes are the a ('anchor') tag and the img ('image') tag.
        A tag requires the href attribute and  the img tag requires the src attribute.

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 

        If we are adding CSS to our web page, the head is utilized to inform the web page that
        the browser is going to be reading CSS. This is done through HTML elements style and link.

    7. What is an id?

        Ids specify a unique id for an HTML element.           

    8. What elements can I add an id to? 

        You can add an ID to whatever element but the difference between an ID and class is that
        you cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 

        IDs can only be applied once within a document.

    10. What is a class? 

        A class is something that we can use in HTML to utilize elements of CSS and JavaScript.
        We have been using classes a way to style multiple elements with a singular class. 

    11. What elements can I add a class to?

        Classes can be used on any element.

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page?

        Classes can be used as many times as needed. 

    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?

        To open a link in a new tab, you would have to add another attribute to the a tag.
            ex.     <a target = "_blank" href = "https://example-site.com"> New Tab link</a>

    14. What is the alt attribute in the image tag used for?

        The alt tag in the img tag isn't required but is best practice to use it to describe an image if the image cannot be displayed.
        <img src ="pine-apple.jpg" alt="Blue Pineapple"</img>

    15. How do I reference an id?

        To reference an id, you would have to use '#' before the id name.
            ex.     <a href = '#example-id'> Example </a>

    16. What is the difference between a section and a div

        The biggest difference between a section and a div tag is that a section is a semantic tag.
        This means that the section tag has inherently more meaning and would be more descriptive in our code.
        Div can be used in the same way but lacks the information that a section tag might. 
        A div can be used to create space, add structure or style elements; using markup like this is referred to as presentational HTML.

    17. What is CSS used for? 

        HTML and CSS work together to create web pages that we are familiar with seeing.
        THe browser reads CSS and applies the different styling rules it has to different elements in our HTML.

    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page

        To select an element in HTML, we use a selector in CSS. 
        The format is as follows:
                h2 {

                }
        This selector applies all rules denoted within the braces to every single h2 element in our HTML code.

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one

        The difference between id and class is that class can be used on multiple elements while id can only be used once per element.
        A good example of using id in code would be to use it to anchor to a certain point in the webpage that you can return to by clickling on a specific element.
        An example of class would be to define styling that would be utilized by multiple different h and p tags.

    20. How do we select classes in CSS?

        Selecting classes in CSS is done through the use of '.';
            ex.     .class-example {

                    }

    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?

        we would do this through:
                p.human {

                }

    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 

        A parent child selector is selecting a specific tag that falls under another tag rather than targetting a tag type on its own.
        Due to specificity, this allows us to target specific tags.
            ex.     div p {
                        /* example code */
                    }

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?

        It would be done like:
            div a.sidebar {
                /* this is example code */
            }

    24. What is a pseudo selector?

        A pseudo selector looks like a CSS selector with a colon following it.
        A specifc usage of a pseudo selector is to define a special state of an element.
            ex.     a:hover {
                         /* can change the state of a elements when hovering over them
                         */
                    }

    25. What do we use the change the spacing between lines?

        You can use the line-height property in CSS.
            ex.     h1 {
                        line-height: 20px;
                        /* can also be done with em units or % */
                    }

    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?

        You can change the spacing between letters through the property: letter-spacing.
        It's default value is normal but can be set to specific px. 

    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?

        This is done through the use of text-transform property.
        text-transform: uppercase; /* changes every text into uppercase */
        text-transform: lowercase; /* changes every text into lowercase */
        text-transform: capitalize; /* changes first letter of every word into capital letters */

    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black?

        To add a border around my div that is dotted and black is done through the border property.
            div {
                border: 1px dotted "black";
            }

    29. How do I select everything on the page? 

        To select everything, it is done with '*'.
                * {
                    /* Any changes implemented here will be applied to every element in HTML
                    */

                }

    30. How do I write a comment in CSS?

        Unlike other common languages, CSS is missing the single line comment.
        However, you can still block comment using:
                /* This is a sample comment
                */

    31. How do I find out what file I am in, when I am using the command line? 

        Using the 'pwd' command will show what directory you are currently in in the terminal.

    32. Using the command line - how do I see a list of files/folders in my current folder?

        Using 'ls' command will list out every single file/directory inside of the current directory you are in.

    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 

        A file is removed through the 'rm' command. 
            ex.     rm 'example-file.txt'
        You have to be careful as unlike a GUI, we will not be prompted with a warning when the command is run; instant deletion.

    34. Why should I use version control? 

        Each team that you work will follow a specific version control and this is done because it is an efficient method of creating and contributing within various memmbers of a team.
        Version controls allows for consistentcy within a team as well as make specific distinct changes that alter the master code.

    35. How often should I commit to github?

        You should commit as often as you deem necessary. A good rule of thumb is you would commit as often as you make nominal changes to your cloned code.

    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github?

        The command we use would be the git push command. 
        If pushing the branch for the first time, this would require the full line of git push -u origin 'branch-name'
        We would then start using git push following that first time.

    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow.

        Lambda's git flow starts from the master code. 
        We first fork from master and create a repo in our GitHub account.
        Add your TL as a collaborator your forked repo.
        From there, you press 'clone or download' and copy the HTTPS link.
        You would then use CLI and head to the directory you would like to make a clone of this repo.
        Create a local repo using the command: git clone 'link-to-repo'
        cd into your newly created local repo.
        Create your own branch through the git command: git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname'.
        This will allow us to make changes to our branch which we can later push to master.

        To add and commit changes:
        git add. allows for you to add all changes made to the branch.
        git commit -m "helpful message" will allow you to commit the added changes to the branch.
        git push -u origin branch-name will allow you to push your newly created branch to your github repo.

        After all the steps listed above, you can submit a pull request to master.
        Go to your forked repo and select 'branch: master'.
        Select your branch and click new pull request button to make a pull request.
        It will redirect you to the pull request page.

        From here, click on dropdown base repository and change it to your forked repo.
        Add your TL to the reviews and submit the pull request.
        The TL will merge your pull request; do not merge your own pull request.
